\description{
Several functions for calculation of community richness indices available via
wrapper functions. They are implemented via the \code{vegan} package.
}
\details{
These include the \sQuote{ace}, \sQuote{Chao1}, \sQuote{Hill}, and
\sQuote{Observed} richness measures.
See details for more information and references.

The richness is calculated per sample. This is a standard index in community
ecology, and it provides an estimate of the number of unique species in the
community. This is often not directly observed for the whole community but
only for a limited sample from the community. This has led to alternative
richness indices that provide different ways to estimate the species
richness.

Richness index differs from the concept of species diversity or evenness in
that it ignores species abundance, and focuses on the binary presence/absence
values that indicate simply whether the species was detected.

The function takes all index names in full lowercase. The user can provide
the desired spelling through the argument \code{\link{name}} (see examples).

The following richness indices are provided.

\itemize{

\item{'ace' }{Abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) is another
nonparametric richness
index that uses sample coverage, defined based on the sum of the
probabilities
of the observed species. This method divides the species into abundant
(more than 10
reads or observations) and rare groups
in a sample and tends to underestimate the real number of species. The
ACE index
ignores the abundance information for the abundant species,
based on the assumption that the abundant species are observed regardless
of their
exact abundance. We use here the bias-corrected version
(O'Hara 2005, Chiu et al. 2014) implemented in
\code{\link[vegan:specpool]{estimateR}}.
For an exact formulation, see \code{\link[vegan:specpool]{estimateR}}.
Note that this index comes with an additional column with standard
error information.}

\item{'chao1' }{This is a nonparametric estimator of species richness. It
assumes that rare species carry information about the (unknown) number
of unobserved species. We use here the bias-corrected version
(O'Hara 2005, Chiu et al. 2014) implemented in
\code{\link[vegan:specpool]{estimateR}}. This index implicitly
assumes that every taxa has equal probability of being observed. Note
that it gives a lower bound to species richness. The bias-corrected
for an exact formulation, see \code{\link[vegan:specpool]{estimateR}}.
This estimator uses only the singleton and doubleton counts, and
hence it gives more weight to the low abundance species.
Note that this index comes with an additional column with standard
error information.}

\item{'hill' }{Effective species richness aka Hill index
(see e.g. Chao et al. 2016).
Currently only the case 1D is implemented. This corresponds to the exponent
of Shannon diversity. Intuitively, the effective richness indicates the
number of
species whose even distribution would lead to the same diversity than the
observed
community, where the species abundances are unevenly distributed.}

\item{'observed' }{The \emph{observed richness} gives the number of species that
is detected above a given \code{detection} threshold in the observed sample
(default 0). This is conceptually the simplest richness index. The
corresponding index in the \pkg{vegan} package is "richness".}

# Names of columns can be chosen arbitrarily, but the length of arguments
# must match.
