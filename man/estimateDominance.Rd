\details{
A dominance index quantifies the dominance of one or few species in a
community. Greater values indicate higher dominance.

Dominance indices are in general negatively correlated with alpha diversity
indices (species richness, evenness, diversity, rarity). More dominant
communities are less diverse.

\code{estimateDominance} calculates the following community dominance
indices:

\itemize{

\item{'absolute' }{Absolute index equals to the absolute abundance of the
most dominant n species of the sample (specify the number with the argument \code{ntaxa}).
Index gives positive integer values.}

\item{'dbp' }{Berger-Parker index (See Berger & Parker 1970) calculation
is a special case of the 'relative' index. dbp is the relative abundance of the most
abundant species of the sample. Index gives values in interval 0 to 1,
where bigger value represent greater dominance.

\deqn{dbp = \frac{N_1}{N_{tot}}}{%
dbp = N_1/N_tot} where \eqn{N_1} is the absolute abundance of the most
dominant species and \eqn{N_{tot}} is the sum of absolute abundances of all
species.}

\item{'core_abundance' }{ Core abundance index is related to core species.
Core species are species that are most abundant in all samples, i.e., in
whole data set. Core species are defined as those species that have
prevalence over 50\\%. It means that in order to belong to core species,
species must be prevalent in 50\\% of samples. Core species are used to
calculate the core abundance index. Core abundance index is sum of relative
abundances of core species in the sample. Index gives values in interval 0 to
1, where bigger value represent greater dominance.

\deqn{core_abundance = \frac{N_{core}}{N_{tot}}}{%
core_abundance = N_core/N_tot} where \eqn{N_{core}} is the sum of absolute
abundance of the core species and \eqn{N_{tot}} is the sum of absolute
abundances of all species.}

\item{'gini' }{ Gini index is probably best-known from socio-economic
contexts (Gini 1921). In economics, it is used to measure, for example, how unevenly
income is distributed among population. Here, Gini index is used similarly,
but income is replaced with abundance.

If there is small group of species
that represent large portion of total abundance of microbes, the inequality
is large and Gini index closer to 1. If all species has equally large
abundances, the equality is perfect and Gini index equals 0. This index
should not be confused with Gini-Simpson index, which quantifies diversity.}

\item{'dmn' }{McNaughton’s index is the sum of relative abundances of the two
most abundant species of the sample (McNaughton & Wolf, 1970). Index gives values in
the unit interval:

\deqn{dmn = (N_1 + N_2)/N_tot}

where \eqn{N_1} and \eqn{N_2} are the absolute
abundances of the two most dominant species and \eqn{N_{tot}} is the sum of
absolute abundances of all species.}

\item{'relative' }{ Relative index equals to the relative abundance of the
most dominant n species of the sample (specify the number with the argument \code{ntaxa}).
This index gives values in interval 0 to 1.

\deqn{relative = N_1/N_tot}

where \eqn{N_1} is the absolute abundance of the most
dominant species and \eqn{N_{tot}} is the sum of absolute abundances of all
species.}

\item{'simpson_lambda' }{ Simpson's (dominance) index or Simpson's lambda is
the sum of squared relative abundances. This index gives values in the unit interval.
This value equals the probability that two randomly chosen individuals belongs to the
same species. The higher the probability, the greater the dominance (See
e.g. Simpson 1949).

\deqn{lambda = \sum(p^2)}

where p refers to relative abundances.

There is also a more advanced Simpson dominance index (Simpson 1949). However,
this is not provided and the simpler squared sum of relative abundances is used
instead as the alternative index is not in the unit interval and it is highly
correlated with the simpler variant implemented here.}
