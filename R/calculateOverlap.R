#' Estimate overlap
#' 
#' This function calculates overlap for all sample-pairs
#' in a \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment}}
#' object.
#'
#' @param x a
#'   \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment}}
#'   object containing a tree.
#'   
#' @param abund_values A single character value for selecting the
#'   \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{assay}}
#'   to calculate the overlap.
#'   
#' @param detection A single numeric value for selecting detection threshold for 
#'   absence/presence of features. Feature that has abundance under threshold in
#'   either of samples, will be discarded when evaluating overlap between samples. 
#'   
#' @param ... Optional arguments not used.
#'   
#' @return calculateOverlap returns sample-by-sample distance matrix. 
#'   runOverlap returns \code{x} that includes overlap matrix in its 
#'   reducedDim. 
#' 
#' @details These function calculates overlap between all the sample-pairs. Overlap
#'   reflects similarity between sample-pairs. 
#'   
#'   When overlap is calculated using relative abundances, the higher the value the 
#'   higher the similarity is, When using relative abundances, overlap value 1 means that 
#'   all the abundances of features are equal between two samples, and 0 means that 
#'   samples have completely different relative abundances.
